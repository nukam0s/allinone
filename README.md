The **AllInOne Protection System** is an advanced Tcl script for Eggdrop bots, designed to provide a modular and channel-configurable protection system, replacing the need for multiple flood scripts and global word lists.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Channel-Specific Modular Protection:** Independent management of `badwords`, `badchans`, and `spamwords` for each channel.
* **8 Protection Types:** Includes message flood, repeat flood, bad words, bad part, bad channel, caps, spam, and **DNSBL** (DNS Blacklist).
* **Refined Permissions:** Granular access control based on global flags (`n/m`) and channel-specific flags (`n/m/o/v`).
* **Flexible Aliases and Commands:** Supports multiple command prefixes (`!@#.`); configurable and persistent aliases (`aliases.conf`).
* **Automatic Migration:** Existing global lists are automatically migrated to channel-specific lists on the first run.
* **Auto-Update:** Use `!update` to fetch the latest version directly from GitHub and reload the script.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

1.  **Download:** Clone or download the script to your Eggdrop `scripts` directory.
    ```bash
    cp allinone.tcl scripts/allinone.tcl
    ```
2.  **Dependencies:** Ensure that `wget` and the Tcl `http` package are installed on your system, as they are required for the auto-update functionality.
3.  **Eggdrop Configuration:** Add the following line to your `eggdrop.conf`:
    ```tcl
    source scripts/allinone.tcl
    ```
4.  **Reload:** Use the `.rehash` or `.reload` command in IRC (or restart the bot).

## üìù Usage (Commands)

The default command prefix is `!`, but it also accepts `@`, `#`, and `.`. All commands work via public message in the channel or via private `MSG` to the bot (in which case, channel commands require the `#channel` parameter).
